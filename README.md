# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

* Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass is a platform that helps students to pass their driving test by providing updated information for the students to study, practice driving, and write tests. The students can schedule thru the platform, download their material and interaction with the customer representatives for better support.

* What did you do particularly well?
I worked on the designed detailed requirements from the Project Owner as well as explaining the functionality of the requirements based on our analysis. The organization of the design was crucial and I put it a priority to make sure that all the customer demands are satisfied.

* If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would like to be revised on both of my projects, even if I think is a  well-developed project, I always like to improve on my work. A different view of point can make me a better organizer, writer, and student for my future classes.

* How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The design was created for easy interaction and approach from the developers. I break down all the requirements and distributed them into their part so I would be able to connect them. The client will require proper requirements for the project to be useful.

* How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
The design would require the requirements of the new functionalities and then the design of the systems adding the features. I would like to get a deep design analysis to improve my design.
